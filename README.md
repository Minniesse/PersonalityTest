"Carry your animal wisdom with you as you return to your world!"

*Share results or retake option appears*

## 7. Score Calculation Logic

The scoring system follows a weighted approach where each answer contributes points to multiple animal archetypes. The primary animal archetype is determined by the highest accumulated score, with the secondary archetype being the second-highest score.

### Scoring Algorithm

1. Initialize a score counter for each of the 12 animal archetypes
2. For each question answered, add the associated points to the relevant animal archetypes
3. After all questions are answered, sort the archetypes by score in descending order
4. The archetype with the highest score becomes the primary result
5. The archetype with the second-highest score becomes the secondary result
6. In case of a tie, certain animals may be prioritized based on the specific combination of traits

### Example Calculation

If a user's responses resulted in these scores:
- Wolf: 25 points
- Owl: 17 points
- Fox: 15 points
- Bear: 12 points
- (Other animals with lower scores)

The primary result would be Wolf, and the secondary result would be Owl.

## 8. Animal Archetype Profiles for Results

For each animal result, provide a rich description including:

1. **Overview**: Brief introduction to the archetype
2. **Key Traits**: 4-5 defining characteristics
3. **Strengths**: What makes this animal archetype powerful
4. **Challenges**: Areas for growth and awareness
5. **Relationships**: How this archetype interacts with others
6. **At Work**: Professional strengths and tendencies
7. **Growth Path**: Suggestions for personal development

### Example Result Profile: Wolf - The Instinctual Teacher

**Overview**: The Wolf represents a powerful balance between fierce independence and deep loyalty to your pack or community. You embody instinct, intelligence, freedom, and guardianship.

**Key Traits**: Intuitive, Loyal, Independent, Strategic

**Strengths**: You possess strong instincts that rarely lead you astray. Your intelligence allows you to navigate complex situations with grace, while your loyalty makes you a treasured friend and ally. You value authentic self-expression and resist constraints that limit your spirit.

**Challenges**: Your 'lone wolf' tendencies might sometimes distance you from others who don't understand your need for space. Your fierce loyalty can occasionally lead to exclusivity or suspicion of outsiders.

**Relationships**: You form deep, meaningful bonds with your 'pack' and will protect them fiercely. While selective about who enters your inner circle, those who do receive unwavering support and loyalty.

**At Work**: You thrive in roles that allow autonomy while supporting a team mission you believe in. You prefer authentic leadership over rigid authority and excel in positions that utilize your strategic thinking and protective instincts.

**Growth Path**: Embracing vulnerability within your trusted circle can deepen your connections. Finding balance between your independence and the richness of community will help you thrive.
